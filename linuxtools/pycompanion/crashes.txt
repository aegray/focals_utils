# possible overflows or at least places I've been able to crash:

1) if you don't respond to StartFileTransfer requests and enough are open, it stops responding

2) CaptureScreenshot with too much data in fileformat crashes screenshot -> not sure about this, 
    it may just produce many diff snapshots

3) CurrentTime, if you send too much data definitely crashes the clock updating in the background

4) Sending invalid parameters to startExperience - especially "%s"*400 as key or value, I think I crashed the entire message service
