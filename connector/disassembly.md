! NOTE !: Before you get started, there isn't much point in disassebling them. The hardware is all incredibly small and very easy to break. The ribbon cables rip with even small amounts of force. 
YOU MAY BREAK YOUR GLASSES DOING THIS. 

With that said, opening the side with the projector is quite easy.

1. Remove the faceplate. 
  - There is a face plate that is glued on. You can pull this off using an exacto knife and being very careful. Find the ridge where the plate and the metal body meet, then run the exacto knife carefully along there, removing the adhesive. This should slowly allow you to pry the plate off.
  - There are small clips along the edge that you should look out for. The clips should easily slide away from the body with some light prying.
2. Removing the USB + Power button + Status LED flexible PCB. 
  - This part is difficult as the ribbon rips easily. I was not able to get the flexible PCB off, but I did rip my cable. 
  - There are two small melted posts holding the metal sheilding in place over the USB POGO pins. You will need to cut these off with the exacto knife. This is not reverible.
